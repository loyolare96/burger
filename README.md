# burger

I was unable to add burgers to the database and change the burgers from uneaten to eaten.

-- Add burgers

Do a post method for the database, taking in the value from the text field and using that as the burger_name column. 
Then the page automatically reloads and shows the new burger in the list

-- Change burger status

Do a put method to change the 'devoured' status of a burger from 'false' to 'true', this causing it to be rendered in the
other side of the screen, separate from the un-devoured burgers.
